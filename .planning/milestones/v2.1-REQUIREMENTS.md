# Requirements: itsascout v2.1

**Defined:** 2026-02-17
**Core Value:** Paste a URL, get a comprehensive scraping report card with real-time progress as each check completes.
**Milestone:** v2.1 Competitive Intelligence

## v2.1 Requirements

Requirements for this milestone. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Common Crawl

- [ ] **CC-01**: Report card shows whether the publisher's domain appears in Common Crawl index
- [ ] **CC-02**: CC presence check queries the CDX Index API with domain wildcard match
- [ ] **CC-03**: CC step is non-critical — API failures produce "data unavailable" not pipeline failure
- [ ] **CC-04**: CC result includes page count and latest crawl date when available

### Google News Signals

- [ ] **GN-01**: Report card shows Google News readiness signals (not binary "included/not included")
- [ ] **GN-02**: Detect news sitemap presence via `xmlns:news` XML namespace in discovered sitemaps
- [ ] **GN-03**: Detect NewsArticle / NewsMediaOrganization schema types from existing structured data
- [ ] **GN-04**: Aggregate signals into readiness level (strong / moderate / minimal / none)

### Update Frequency

- [ ] **UF-01**: Report card shows estimated publishing frequency (e.g., "~3 articles/day")
- [ ] **UF-02**: Primary estimation from RSS feed publication dates via feedparser
- [ ] **UF-03**: Fallback estimation from sitemap lastmod dates when RSS unavailable
- [ ] **UF-04**: Frequency estimate includes confidence indicator (high/medium/low based on sample size)

### Pipeline Integration

- [ ] **PIPE-01**: New steps integrate into existing sequential pipeline with SSE progress events
- [ ] **PIPE-02**: New model fields on Publisher (flat) and ResolutionJob (JSON) follow existing patterns
- [ ] **PIPE-03**: Publisher freshness TTL skip path copies new fields correctly for cached results
- [ ] **PIPE-04**: New steps appear in SSE progress stream with proper step names

### Report Card UI

- [ ] **UI-01**: Competitive Intelligence section in report card displays all three signals
- [ ] **UI-02**: CC presence shows page count and crawl date when available, graceful "unavailable" otherwise
- [ ] **UI-03**: Google News readiness shows signal breakdown with readiness level badge
- [ ] **UI-04**: Update frequency shows estimated rate with confidence indicator

## Deferred

Tracked but not in v2.1 scope.

### Authentication

- **AUTH-01**: User can sign up and log in with Django built-in auth
- **AUTH-02**: Report card pages can be private to authenticated users

### Extended Intelligence

- **EXT-01**: CCBot blocking correlation (robots.txt disallow for CCBot vs CC presence)
- **EXT-02**: Historical CC crawl trend (multiple crawl snapshots over time)
- **EXT-03**: Competitor comparison (side-by-side intelligence for multiple publishers)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Google News Publisher Center API | Requires publisher authentication, not available to third parties |
| Full sitemap crawling | Discover and sample sitemaps only — full crawl is out of scope |
| Full RSS feed content parsing | Only extract dates for frequency — content parsing is separate concern |
| Real-time CC API monitoring | Single point-in-time check per analysis, not ongoing monitoring |
| Batch/bulk competitive analysis | Single-URL flow first, batch later |

## Traceability

| UF-01 | Phase 15 | Pending |
| UF-02 | Phase 15 | Pending |
| UF-03 | Phase 15 | Pending |
| UF-04 | Phase 15 | Pending |
| PIPE-01 | Phase 17 | Done |
| PIPE-02 | Phase 13 | Done |
| PIPE-03 | Phase 17 | Done |
| PIPE-04 | Phase 17 | Done |
| UI-01 | Phase 18 | Pending |
| UI-02 | Phase 18 | Pending |
| UI-03 | Phase 18 | Pending |
| UI-04 | Phase 18 | Pending |
