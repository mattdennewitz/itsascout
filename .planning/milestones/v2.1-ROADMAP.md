- [x] **Phase 18: Competitive Intelligence UI** - Report card section displaying all three signals -- completed 2026-02-18

## Phase Details

### Phase 13: Data Foundation

**Goal:** All competitive intelligence data has a home in the database before any steps produce it
**Depends on:** Phase 11 (existing models)
**Requirements:** PIPE-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Publisher model has fields for CC presence, news sitemap, Google News readiness, and update frequency
  2. ResolutionJob model has JSONFields for cc_result, sitemap_analysis_result, frequency_result, and news_signals_result
  3. Migration applies cleanly and existing data is unaffected (all new fields nullable)
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md -- Add competitive intelligence fields to Publisher and ResolutionJob, generate migration, add tests

### Phase 14: Common Crawl Presence

**Goal:** Users can see whether their publisher domain appears in Common Crawl and how extensively it has been crawled
**Depends on:** Phase 13
**Requirements:** CC-01, CC-02, CC-03, CC-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Pipeline queries the CC CDX Index API with domain wildcard match and reports presence
  2. When present, the result includes estimated page count and latest crawl date
  3. CC API failures or timeouts produce "data unavailable" -- never a pipeline failure
  4. CC step emits SSE start/complete events and saves results to ResolutionJob
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md -- Add run_cc_step function, wire into supervisor with SSE events and TTL skip, add tests

### Phase 15: Content Signals

**Goal:** Users can see news sitemap presence and estimated publishing frequency for their publisher
**Depends on:** Phase 13, existing sitemap discovery (Phase 9), existing RSS discovery (Phase 9)
**Requirements:** GN-02, UF-01, UF-02, UF-03, UF-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Sitemap analysis step fetches discovered sitemaps and detects `xmlns:news` XML namespace
  2. Update frequency step parses RSS feed dates via feedparser and computes publishing interval
  3. When RSS is unavailable, frequency falls back to sitemap lastmod dates
  4. Frequency estimate includes confidence indicator based on sample size and date span
  5. Both steps emit SSE events and save results to ResolutionJob
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md -- Step functions (sitemap analysis + frequency estimation) + feedparser install + unit tests
- [x] 15-02-PLAN.md -- Supervisor wiring (SSE events, save to ResolutionJob, update Publisher flat fields)

### Phase 16: Google News Readiness

**Goal:** Users can see an honest assessment of their publisher's Google News optimization signals
**Depends on:** Phase 15 (sitemap analysis provides news sitemap signal), existing article extraction (Phase 10)
**Requirements:** GN-01, GN-03, GN-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Aggregation step combines news sitemap presence, NewsArticle schema, and NewsMediaOrganization schema
  2. Signals produce a readiness level (strong / moderate / minimal / none) -- never a binary "in/not in" answer
  3. Step runs after article extraction (needs schema type data) with no new HTTP requests
  4. Step emits SSE events and saves results to ResolutionJob
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 16-01-PLAN.md -- Fix article extraction @type + Google News readiness step function + TDD tests
- [x] 16-02-PLAN.md -- Wire Google News step into pipeline supervisor with SSE events

### Phase 17: Pipeline Integration

**Goal:** All new steps work correctly within the existing pipeline lifecycle -- cached results, progress tracking, and supervisor orchestration
**Depends on:** Phases 14, 15, 16 (all steps must exist)
**Requirements:** PIPE-01, PIPE-03, PIPE-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Publisher freshness TTL skip path copies all new result fields correctly for cached analyses
  2. SSE progress stream includes proper step names for all new steps (started/completed/skipped events)
  3. Full pipeline runs end-to-end with all new steps in correct order without exceeding timeout
  4. Cached (skipped) pipeline runs emit skip events for new steps and display prior results
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 17-01-PLAN.md -- Backend TTL skip path, view fallback, and serializer field coverage
- [x] 17-02-PLAN.md -- Frontend PIPELINE_STEPS, stepDataSummary, initialStatuses, and divider index

### Phase 18: Competitive Intelligence UI

**Goal:** Users see a Competitive Intelligence section in the report card displaying all three signals clearly
**Depends on:** Phase 17 (all data flowing correctly)
**Requirements:** UI-01, UI-02, UI-03, UI-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Report card has a Competitive Intelligence section showing CC presence, Google News readiness, and update frequency
  2. CC presence shows page count and crawl date when available, graceful "unavailable" message otherwise
  3. Google News readiness shows individual signal breakdown with a readiness level badge
  4. Update frequency shows estimated rate with confidence indicator
  5. All three sub-sections handle missing/unavailable data gracefully (no blank cards, no errors)
**Plans:** 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 18-01-PLAN.md -- Competitive Intelligence Card with CC presence, Google News readiness, and update frequency sub-sections
